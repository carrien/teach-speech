# teach-speech
Acoustics visualizations and demos for teaching.

## Software
This project contains code (mostly in MATLAB) that may be useful in course preparation for topics related to acoustics, speech science, and hearing science.

## Activities
In additional to the code contained in this repository, I maintain templates for online activities (mostly in Google Sheets) that can be copied and shared with students for collaborative in-class projects.
* [Pictures of sound](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XFK9b-pxcY5NyJygdUN0JbNGHEXVbWSjDWMQtHYK_6g/edit?usp=sharing): Visualization of complex waves
* Perceptual distance maps (two versions: [musical instruments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18bPKWR2V6ZF0tQu0xAXADf-IIGQ6vUIwby4ZZ-HfZY8/edit?usp=sharing) or [animal sounds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDkvHQf6byZ9y1QORoQCKwm_UOYeXJ4uIC3hdlXYkf8/edit?usp=sharing))
